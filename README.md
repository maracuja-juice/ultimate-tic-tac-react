## Game Rules

> For an interactive explanation you can go to our [how to play page](https://playtictactoe.xyz/howtoplay).

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is played with 9 small tic-tac-toe boards.
Each turn a player marks a field. When you get three signs in a row (diagonal, vertical or horizontal) on a small board, youâ€™ve won that board.
To win the game, you need to win three small boards in a row.

But here's the **twist:**
Each turn the previous move of your opponent dictates in which board you can move next.

For example the first player makes this move in one of the small boards:
```
[ ][X][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]
```
The second player can in the next turn only play in the tiles that are marked with a `!`. These are tiles from the small board that are equivalent to the position of the last move.
```
[ ][ ][ ]   [!][!][!]   [ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [!][!][!]   [ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [!][!][!]   [ ][ ][ ]

[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]

[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][X][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]   [ ][ ][ ]
```

If your opponent sends you to a board that's already won, you can make your move on **any** of the other boards.
If one of the small boards results in a tie, the board counts for neither X nor O.
