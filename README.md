# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a browser game made with React and Redux.

## What

This is a board game that consists of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. Every move on a small board sends the opponent to an equivalent on the big board. If you win a small board you get a position on the big board. And with three small boards in a row you win the game. [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe)
